# Distributed-Systems: "Chinese Whispers"

## 1. Introduction
This project is part of the examination submission in Distributed Systems (HHZ DBE SS22) of Group 1:

* Nadine Bisswang
* Johannes Deufel
* Jonas Pfaff
* Philipp Straub

## 2. Intention
The application is an implementation of the childrens game "Chinese Whispers" in an distributed system. The project follows the peer-to-peer architecture of an distributed system, meaning that all participants are more or less equal.

## 3. Setup
As the application is intended to work in an distributed system, you need at least 3 machines (either pyhsical or virtual) being connected through the same local network. These machines need to be allowed to communicate via TCP and UDP connections.

To start playing the game, you need to have installed **python 3** on all of your machines.

Start the game by executing the **main.py** file on all of the machines. To ensure a proper functionality, you should wait around 10 seconds before starting the next peer.
